# Fake Windows Updater


Idk, i was bored making this

if you wanna build this make sure you have xmake, MSVC, and NSIS installed

build the binaries via running `run.bat` in the x64 Native Command Prompt, and then open NSIS and compile the installer.nsi script to get the finished Self-Extracting Executable binary
